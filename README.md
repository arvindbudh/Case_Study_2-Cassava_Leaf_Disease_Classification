# Project_3-Cassava_Leaf_Disease_Classification

This project is on kaggle competition Cassava Leaf Disease Classification. Identify the type of disease present in Cassava Leaf image. This competition, has a dataset of 21,367 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda.The task is to classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. So that, farmers may be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage.

This is a Computer Vision problem where we have to try differernt CV models.Submissions are evaluated based on their categorization accuracy.

## Data Set:

**Files:**

[train/test]_images : the image files. Roughly 15,000 images in the test set.

[train/test]_tfrecords : the image files in tfrecord format.

sample_submission.csv : A properly formatted sample submission, given the disclosed test set content.

label_num_to_disease_map.json : The mapping between each disease code and the real disease name.

**train.csv**

image_id : the image file name.

label : the ID code for the disease.
